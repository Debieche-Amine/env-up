# My Personal Linux Setup
A place where i ll be keeping my configs. Just a personal setup, feel free to try it,


# Vim
I use **Neovim** with the AstroNvim distro,
all my changes to the AstroNvim defaults live in **./nvim/lua/polish.lua** and **./nvim/lua/me/\***

install it with **./install-nvim-config** wich will essentially copy ./nvim to ~/.config/nvim

AstroNvim works best with it's dependencies, but only Neovim v0.10+ is required.
[Download nvim-0.11.4](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/download/stable/nvim-linux-x86_64.appimage). 
See [AstroNvim](https://docs.astronvim.com/) for details.
